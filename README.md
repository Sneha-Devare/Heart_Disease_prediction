## 🤖 **Machine Learning Models Used**

This is a **binary classification problem**, where models predict whether heart disease is present or not.

### 🔹 **Model Building Process**
- Trained multiple machine learning models  
- Evaluated and compared model performance  
- Selected the best-performing model  

### 🔹 **Models Implemented**
- **Logistic Regression** – baseline classification model

## 📊 **Model Evaluation**
Models were evaluated using standard classification metrics:

- **Accuracy Score**  
- **Confusion Matrix**  
- **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)  

This helped identify the most reliable model for heart disease prediction.

---

## 📈 **Key Insights**
- Age and chest pain type are strong indicators of heart disease  
- Higher cholesterol and blood pressure increase risk  
- Exercise-induced angina shows clear relation with heart disease  
- Ensemble models performed better than single models  

---

## 🧾 **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how **medical data analysis and machine learning** can help in early detection of heart disease.  
It highlights the importance of preprocessing, EDA, and model evaluation in building reliable healthcare prediction systems.
